# Titanic_Machine_Learning_python

Data analysis using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### Dataset Description

The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. My model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class.

The test set was used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. The dataset do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. For each passenger in the test set, I am using the model to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
